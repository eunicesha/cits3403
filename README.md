About:

Roshambo'd! is an online game, based on the idea of a classic paper, scissors,
rock game. Users will first be prompted to sign in, or register for an account
if they don't already have one.
Upon signing in, the user is greeted by a quick description and guide of the game. The main purpose of the website is then shown; a screen of 'challenges' will be presented, either showing 'no games have been created', or 'challenge cards' that have been created by other users. Users can then 'accept' another users challenge, or create their own.
This is where an list of options are presented: paper, scissors, or rock. Submitting one own's challenge will create their own challenge card for others to see, otherwise submitting an option against someone else's challenge will determine a winner/loser (based on paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, etc).
The winner will then be granted a point, with the loser having a point deducted.
Our website also features a leaderboard and a profile section. The leaderboard will present all users, ordered by their respective points.
The profile section showcases the user's name, points, image, last login details and a record of their past games. There is also an option to edit their profile, changing their username, or adding an optional 'about me' text.
Users can also log out, prompting them to the sign-in page again.
