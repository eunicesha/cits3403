Some ideas:

Harry Potter theme:
- Upon creating an account on the website, user gets sorted into the 4 houses (Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw)
- each forum/message board can be exclusive to the house, or we can include different classes, allowing poeple from other 
houses to speak to each other during class/other activities
- each user's house will be tagged next to their name whenever they post on the forum.

Video game idea:
- users can create their own request/chatboard, players can reply to them and 'challenge' them. 
whoever wins the 'challenge' gets 1 point (and loser gets deducted a point).
- leaderboard keeps track of who has most points
- can do something simple like paper scissors rock. 
e.g. user 1 creates a post and types in rock. a message board will appear on the main page saying user1 is proposing a challenge,
but doesnt show that user1 chose rock. then user2 sees this and replies their answer, e.g. paper.
The website then determines who the winner is, user2 in this case and allocates user2 a point, and deducts a point from user1.


~~Satirical Cooking idea:~~
- users can make a post starting with one ingredient. e.g. user1 says bacon
- other users can type a single ingredient of their own as a reply
- after x amount of replies the website says something like 'you have made ___!'~~

e.g.

user1: bacon
user2: watermelon
user3: bread
system: you have made a bacon watermelon sandwhich!

Art gallery:
> Upon entering art gallery plaform, users are given certain amount of coins or tokens.
> With these, they interact with the art on the platform.
> Users can showcase and sell their arts, to increase their token balance. 
> They can buy other users' art.
> The plaform dashboard displays users with the highest art sales, feature to search art by keyword, sort the arts by the highest or lowest value, etc.

Functionality of PSR website:
- users can gamble points, ie play for 10 points but lose 10 points if you lose 
- users request: '<username> wants to play for 100 points,' request stores their move 
- users respond with a move
- search function: search based on username of number of points
