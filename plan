Idea: Video game idea
- 'Paper scissors rock' (for now)

Frontend:
- Introduction: Explains game rules
- Login or Register an account
- Users can see people seeking a challenge. (We should provide bots that seek challenges too so it doesn't look empty)

Backend:
- Flask for server
- SQLite for database, storing accounts, game results, challenges/requests
- Must be able to authenticate users and sessions
- handle outcomes of games/challenges and issue points to each player
- AJAX for real-time interaction of website
